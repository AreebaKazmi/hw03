  \titledquestion{12.4}[5]
  Let $G$ be an undirected graph. We say $G$ is {\it connected} if, for every pair of vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$, there is a path from $i$ to $j$ (since $G$ is undirected, there is also a path from $j$ to $i$). Show how to test if $G$ is connected in $O(n + m)$ time.

  \titledquestion{12.5}[5]
  Let $G$ be an undirected graph. A {\it connected-component labelling} of $G$ partitions the vertices of $G$ into maximal sets, each of which forms a connected subgraph. Show how to compute a connected component labelling of $G$ in $O(n + m)$ time.

  \end{solution}

  \titledquestion{12.7}[10]
  We say that a directed graph $G$ is {\it strongly-connected} if, for every pair of vertices $i$ and $j$ in $G$,there is a path from $i$ to $j$. Show how to test if $G$ is strongly-connected in $O(n + m)$ time.

  \end{solution}

  \titledquestion{12.10*}[15]
  A {\it universal sink} in a graph $G$ is a vertex that is the target of $nâˆ’1$ edges and the source of no edges.\footnote{A universal sink, $v$, is also sometimes called a {\it celebrity}: Everyone in the room recognizes $v$, but $v$ doesn't recognize anyone else in the room.} Design an algorithm that tests if a graph $G$, represented as an AdjacencyMatrix, has a universal sink. Your algorithm should run in $O(n)$ time.\\
  \underline{Hint}: Draw a few graphs with a universal sink and observe their adjacency matrix.

  \titledquestion{Graph Complement}[15]

  The complement of an undirected graph $G$ is a graph $H$ on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of $H$ are adjacent (connected by an edge) if and only if they are not adjacent in $G$.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_graph}} Prove that if $G$ is not a connected graph then its complement $H$ is a connected graph.

    % Write your solution here
  \end{solution}

  \titledquestion{Topological Sort}

  A {\it topological sort} or {\it topological ordering} of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge $(u,v)$ from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, $u$ comes before $v$ in the ordering.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting}}

  Find a topological ordering of each of the following two graphs.
